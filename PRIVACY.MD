IceCubesApp does not collect or process any personal information from its users. The app is used to connect to third-party Mastodon servers that may or may not collect personal information and are not covered by this privacy policy. Each third-party Mastodon server comes equipped with its own privacy policy that can be viewed through the app or through that server's website.

IceCubesApp can optionally use the OpenAI API to generate descriptions for uploaded media. When you use this feature, your uploaded media is sent to the OpenAI server in order to generate a description. Please refer to the [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) if you want to know more. Nothing is sent to OpenAI if you don't use this feature.

Ice Cubes use TelemetryDeck to collect anonymized usage data. This helps us understand how our users are using our app and how we can improve it. TelemetryDeck does not collect any personally identifiable information. You can read more about TelemetryDeck’s [privacy policy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy)
